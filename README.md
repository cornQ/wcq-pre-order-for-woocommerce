## 📦 Description

**WCQ Pre-Order for WooCommerce** allows you to mark any product as pre-order from the Inventory tab on the product edit screen. When enabled, the standard **Add to Cart** button is replaced with a **Pre-Order** button, and orders are automatically set to a custom status: **Pre-Ordered**.

Whether you're launching new products or accepting purchases for out-of-stock items, this plugin helps you capture more orders and improve user experience.
