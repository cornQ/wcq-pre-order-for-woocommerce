WCQ Pre-Order for WooCommerce allows marking products for pre-order. Adds a “Pre-Order” button and sets orders to a custom “Pre-Ordered” status.

== Description ==

**WCQ Pre-Order for WooCommerce** lets you enable pre-orders for any product in your WooCommerce store. Whether you're launching a new item, handling restocks, or allowing early purchases, this plugin gives your customers the ability to place orders even when products are out of stock.

Easily enable pre-order from the Inventory tab of your product. Once enabled, the default "Add to Cart" button is replaced with a "Pre-Order" button. Orders placed with pre-order items will automatically receive a new status: **Pre-Ordered**.

= Benefits =
- Prevents loss of sales due to stockouts
- Helps promote upcoming products before launch
- Provides clear communication to customers on pre-order items

= Highlights =
* Enable Pre-Order per product via inventory settings
* Show "Pre-Order" button on product pages
* Auto-assign "Pre-Ordered" status to relevant orders
* Accept orders for out-of-stock items
* Optional pre-order quantity override
* Hide "Buy Now" button for out-of-stock regular products
* Display cart and order warning messages for pre-order items
* Secure and lightweight, built using WordPress best practices

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install it through the WordPress admin panel under Plugins > Add New.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Edit any product and navigate to the "Inventory" tab to enable Pre-Order.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I set how many units can be pre-ordered? =
Yes! You can specify a "Pre-Order Stock Quantity" in the product’s Inventory settings. If left blank, a default value of 9999 is used.

= What if a product is out of stock? =
If the product is marked for Pre-Order, it will still be purchasable and treated as "in stock" to allow ordering. The "Buy Now" button is hidden for regular out-of-stock products.

= How will I know which orders are pre-orders? =
Any order containing a pre-order product will be marked with a custom status: **Pre-Ordered**.
